## Map Color System

When creating map files in Aseprite:

- **Magenta (#FF00FF)** - Collision areas (walls, objects)
- **Cyan (#00FFFF)** - Door entrances
- **Yellow (#FFFF00)** - Overlay layer (draws over player - trees, roofs)
- **Orange (#FF8800)** - Collision + overlay (solid walls that render over player)

## Development

### Adding New Canvases

1. Export canvas as `day-XXX.png` (256×256)
2. Create map file `day-XXX-map.png` with marker colors
3. Create new HTML file or update door routing
4. Add canvas images to `assets/` folder

### Creating Minigames

Use `difference-mapper.html` to:
1. Load a canvas image
2. Mark interactive pixels
3. Export JSON data
4. Integrate with game logic
